# Sem1Portfolio
Consists of python projects done in semester 1

Rock Paper Scissors:
This project inputs a players choice and plays it against the computer. It keeps track of the player and computer's score and the player has a choice in how many rounds they can play. This code uses the random library to generate random plays for the computer. 
Multiplication Quiz:
This project uses the random library to generate random multiplication questions for the user. The player can choose how many questions and see how long they have spent on the quiz. This project taught me how to incorporate random.randint into string functions so they don't randomize outside of the string. 
Calculator:
This project inputs two numbers and a mathematical operation (-,+,/,x) and gives the answer. It continues to loop/ask for an operation. It uses a while loop so the code continues to run until the user breaks/ends the loop.
Pokemon:
This project is a pokemon game where the player can level up, train, do gym battles, evolve, and display the pokemon's level and current evolution. Players have the options of training and battling a gym leader to level up their pokemon. This code uses if and conditional statements to monitor the levels of the pokemon.
Number Guesser:
This project lets the player guess a number and the computer tells if the player's number is too low or high. It allows for the player to choose the difficulty level where it expands the number range. This code uses if and conditional statements to tell if the player's number is too high or low. 
Slot Machine:
This project lets the player play a slot machine game where they roll 3 different emojis and win different amounts of points for different combos. It allows the player to bet credits which change the weight or probability of getting a specific combo. This code uses lists to store the different symbols/emojis.
Random Image:
This project recommends a random ice cream flavor. It allows the player to input a random number and outputs an ice cream recomendation with a small description. This code uses a while loop to loop the game until the player enters "no" to break the loop.
